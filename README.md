# CarRent
This project is about renting a car. Opening and maintaining a car rental location is a decision to make very carefully, 
as it can incur a lot of overhead costs. If the location does not perform as expected, 
it can have negative impact on the bottom line. 
So, we came up with the solution of renting the vehicle directly from the owner.
Owner posts that vehicle is available to rent and the customer can rent it immediately.
