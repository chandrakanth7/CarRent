This project is about renting a car. Opening and maintaining a car rental location is a decision to make very carefully, 
as it can incur a lot of overhead costs. If the location does not perform as expected, 
it can have negative impact on the bottom line. 
So, we came up with the solution of renting the vehicle directly from the owner.
Owner posts that vehicle is available to rent and the customer can rent it immediately.

For building this app, we are gonna need a database for storing user details and we will be using Firebase as our database.

Regarding outside API's, we will be using Google Maps API to get the location of users based on their current location.

The implementation of using firebase and maps API have been successfully integrated to our application.
